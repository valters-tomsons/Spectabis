# Spectabis
Spectabis is a free custom frontend for PlayStation®2 emulator PCSX2. Without tinkering for hours with settings for each game or creating complicated setups for each game, Spectabis takes it all from your hands so you enjoy what matters - your games.

You can configure most of the emulation settings, graphical settings, input, sound and manage shaders without leaving Spectabis. Spectabis will handle your game files and appropriate box art covers, connect you to game's PCSX2-Wiki page for even faster and easier game library management.

This is a "successor" to [first Spectabis](https://github.com/Spectabis/PCSX2-Spectabis) which I wrote without any programming experience and using ancient WinForms. While this new version still doesn't resemble anything close to clean and pretty code, it has many more features and is more easier to work with.
